# TicTacToe

This program is made as a progressive learning process using a simple idea to tackle much more advanced topics. 
There will be revisits within the near future to improve upon this project and reimplement the win condition statement into the project

This tictactoe program is completed however it can be improved upon the win condition to be perform with various other methods to display the winner such as
adding the button id into an array list then utlizing that to compare, using a 3 by 3 tuple array to register the location of the grid upon the program. 
These methods are made to store the onclick events and indicate to the program when to declare a winner.

As of July 7th 2024 the program in its basic form is completed however possible future improvements include:
1) Allowing this program to be deployable upon download
2) Creating a score board at the top right corner
3) Creating a welcome screen to start
4) Allowing user to switch based on who has won upon the last turn
5) Randomizer to dictate who starts first

There are 3 variants of this project
first to create the game
second to establish the usage of porting classes and dependency from elsewhere in
third to condense the code and allow the program to run on less code as possible (a merger of the first two)

In future revisits there may be more variants to maintain old versions of the program
